# Low-Hanging Fruit: Thoughts on Economics PhD Applications

#### By Joshua Levy | May 23rd, 2023

## Subheading H2

Do we need to put regular text in-between headings?

### Subheading 3

Lorem ipsum dolor something something something

This is some more regular text.

This should be some **bold** text and this should be the _italic_
alternative. I can't really tell what makes this work or not.

Maybe we need some more space. Let's try to insert a [link](https://www.nytimes.com). We are also going to try an internal [link](/public/profile_picture.jpg) to test internal paths. Below that we're going to embed an image:

![Alt text for image](/profile_picture.jpg)

> Here's a block quote, in theory

Finally let's try out a code in-line as `this_should_be` and as a block

```python
%Test codeblock
import os
import pandas as pd

random_state_seed = 987654321
task_status_df = pd.read_csv('task_status.csv')
task_scores_df = pd.read_csv('task_scores.csv')

task1a_answer_key_df = pd.read_csv('task1a_joshua_levy.csv')
task1b_answer_key_df = pd.read_csv('task1b_joshua_levy.csv')
task1b_misc_df = pd.read_csv('task1b_joshua_levy_MISC_OBS.csv')

### First, identify if there are any new tasks to be scored.
def candidates_to_score(status_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    to_score_df = status_df.copy()
    to_score_df = to_score_df[to_score_df.task1a_status == 2 | to_score_df.task1b_status == 2]

    return to_score_df.iterrows()

def update_score_status(status_df: pd.DataFrame, candidate_name: str):
    updated_status_df = status_df.copy()

    updated_status_df.loc[updated_status_df.candidate_name == candidate_name, 'task1a_status'] = 3
    updated_status_df.loc[updated_status_df.candidate_name == candidate_name, 'task1b_status'] = 3

    updated_status_df.to_csv('task_status.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')

    return

```

and a little bit of math: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
\end{bmatrix}
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout> {children}</Layout>;
